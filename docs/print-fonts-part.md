- pricking is not applicable to printed books, but its thesaurus has a n/a entry for this.
- sheet formats (one or more can be selected) for printed books are defined in features using a corresponding thesaurus (`cod-fr-layout-features`), which is role-dependent. This allows to define features only for print (for sheet formats at least), if fragments do not require them.
